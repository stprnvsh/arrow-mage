# Fixes and Improvements to the Arrow-Mage Framework

This document summarizes the key fixes and improvements made to the Arrow-Mage codebase during development.

## Julia CrossLink Fixes

### 1. JSON Serialization

**Issue**: The `compute_schema_hash` function in Julia used the `sort=true` parameter with `JSON.json()`, but the Julia JSON library doesn't support this keyword argument.

**Fix**: Modified the function to manually sort column names before serialization:

```julia
function compute_schema_hash(df::DataFrame)
    schema_dict = Dict(
        "columns" => sort(names(df)),
        "dtypes" => Dict(name => string(eltype(df[!, name])) for name in sort(names(df)))
    )
    schema_str = JSON.json(schema_dict)
    return bytes2hex(sha1(schema_str))
end
```

### 2. DuckDB Pragma Update

**Issue**: The code was using `PRAGMA force_parallelism`, but newer versions of DuckDB have renamed this to `verify_parallelism`.

**Fix**: Updated all instances of the pragma across files:

```julia
# Replace
DBInterface.execute(manager.conn, "PRAGMA force_parallelism")

# With
DBInterface.execute(manager.conn, "PRAGMA verify_parallelism")
```

### 3. Arrow Integration

**Issue**: The integration between Julia's DataFrames and Arrow/DuckDB had compatibility issues, causing problems when sharing data between languages.

**Fix**: Improved Arrow table registration and made sure all type conversions were handled properly.

## Python/R Integration Improvements

### 1. Resource Monitoring

Enhanced resource monitoring capabilities in all language implementations to provide better insights into memory usage, execution time, and other performance metrics.

### 2. Error Handling

Improved error handling for cross-language data transfer, particularly for edge cases and large datasets.

### 3. Schema Evolution Tracking

Enhanced the schema evolution tracking system to better handle changes to data structures over time.

## Pipeline Execution Fixes

### 1. Data Transfer

Fixed issues with data transfer between pipeline nodes, ensuring correct parameter passing and data type compatibility.

### 2. Memory Management

Implemented better memory management for large datasets, including chunking and streaming capabilities.

### 3. Progress Reporting

Enhanced progress reporting for long-running pipeline operations.

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Chunked Processing

Implemented chunked processing for large datasets to reduce memory footprint.

### 2. Arrow-based Data Sharing

Optimized Arrow-based data sharing between languages to minimize overhead.

### 3. Parallel Execution

Enhanced parallelism configuration for better multi-core utilization.

## Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation including:

1. README with architecture overview
2. Example pipeline explanations
3. API documentation for all languages
4. Setup and configuration guides

These fixes have significantly improved the stability, performance, and usability of the Arrow-Mage framework, particularly for cross-language data processing pipelines.
