# Setting Up Your GitHub Repository

Follow these steps to push your Arrow-Mage code to a new GitHub repository:

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., `arrow-mage`)
4. Add a description (optional): "Cross-language data processing framework built on Arrow and DuckDB"
5. Choose whether to make the repository public or private
6. Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have those)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push your local repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show instructions for pushing an existing repository. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/arrow-mage.git

# Push your code to the remote repository
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.

## 3. Verify the repository

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page to see your code
2. Ensure all files have been uploaded correctly
3. The README.md should be displayed on the repository's main page

## 4. Additional Steps (Optional)

Consider adding the following to your GitHub repository:

1. **GitHub Actions**: Set up CI/CD workflows for testing
2. **Issue Templates**: Add templates for bug reports and feature requests
3. **License**: If you haven't already, add a license file
4. **Contributing Guidelines**: Add instructions for contributors

Congratulations! Your Arrow-Mage project is now on GitHub and ready for collaboration and further development.
