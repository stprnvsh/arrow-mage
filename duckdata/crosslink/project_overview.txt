CROSSLINK: CROSS-LANGUAGE DATA SHARING FRAMEWORK
======================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
CrossLink is a high-performance framework for sharing data between multiple programming languages with minimal overhead. It addresses a critical challenge in data science and analytical workflows: the inefficient transfer of data between different language runtimes. By leveraging Apache Arrow's columnar memory format and implementing a unified C++ core with language-specific bindings, CrossLink enables zero-copy data sharing across C++, Python, R, and Julia.

The project uses a dual licensing model: free for testing, evaluation, academic research, and personal non-commercial use, while enterprise/commercial applications require a license.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
---------------------
CrossLink employs a layered architecture consisting of four primary components:

1. C++ Core (libcrosslink)
--------------------------
The central component is a high-performance C++ library implementing the fundamental functionality through the `crosslink::CrossLink` class. It manages:

- Table Registry: Maps dataset names/IDs to Arrow table references
- Memory Management: Uses `std::shared_ptr<arrow::Table>` for table lifetimes
- Arrow Integration: Handles exchange of table data structures
- DuckDB Integration: Enables SQL query execution across registered tables
- Metadata Services: Tracks dataset lineage, schema, and access patterns
- Notification System: Publishes data change events to subscribers
- Flight Integration: Provides distributed data sharing across machines

The core implementation uses the pimpl idiom (`CrossLink::Impl`) to hide implementation details while maintaining a clean API. It employs RAII with smart pointers for memory management and ensures basic thread safety through reference counting.

2. Language Binding Layer
------------------------
Each target language (Python, R, Julia) connects to the C++ core through a dedicated binding layer:

- Python: Uses `pybind11` to wrap C++ objects, integrates with `pandas` and `pyarrow`
- R: Uses `Rcpp` to create bindings, integrates with R's `data.frame` and the `arrow` package
- Julia: Uses `CxxWrap.jl` to create bindings, integrates with `DataFrames.jl` and `Arrow.jl`

Each binding provides:
- Idiomatic interfaces with language-appropriate naming and object patterns
- Data type conversion between native types and Arrow format
- Integration with language-specific garbage collection/reference counting
- Error handling that translates between C++ exceptions and language exceptions
- Fallback mechanisms when C++ bindings are unavailable

3. Apache Arrow Integration
--------------------------
Arrow provides the memory model and data structure for efficient cross-language sharing. Key components include:

- Shared Memory Buffers: Arrow's memory layout enables direct access without copying
- Zero-Copy Exchange: Pointers to buffers are shared instead of data itself
- Schema Preservation: Type information is preserved across language boundaries
- Arrow C Data Interface: Enables sharing buffers across language boundaries
- Flight Protocol: High-performance RPC for data transfer between processes

4. Data Persistence Layer
------------------------
DuckDB integration provides optional persistence and querying capabilities:

- File-based Storage: Persists data to disk when needed
- SQL Interface: Powerful query capabilities across tables
- Native Arrow Support: Direct registration of Arrow tables
- Unified Query Layer: Common SQL interface for all languages

OPERATION MODES
--------------
CrossLink supports two primary modes of operation:

1. Local Mode
------------
In local mode, CrossLink facilitates data sharing between different languages on the same machine. This is accomplished through shared memory and Arrow's memory layout that enables zero-copy data sharing between processes.

2. Distributed Mode
-----------------
Distributed mode leverages Apache Arrow Flight to enable data sharing between processes running on different machines. The Flight architecture consists of:

- Flight Server: Handles requests for data from remote clients
- Flight Client: Requests data from remote servers
- gRPC Stream: Efficiently transmits record batches between nodes

Configuration for distributed mode can be set through the `CrossLinkConfig` class or environment variables like `CROSSLINK_MODE`, `CROSSLINK_FLIGHT_HOST`, and `CROSSLINK_FLIGHT_PORT`.

KEY APIS
-------
CrossLink exposes several core APIs across all language bindings:

1. Data Exchange API
-------------------
- `push()`: Share a table with other languages/processes
- `pull()`: Retrieve a table shared by another language/process
- `query()`: Execute SQL queries on registered tables
- `list_datasets()`: Enumerate available datasets

2. Flight API
------------
- `flight_push()`: Share a table with a remote node
- `flight_pull()`: Retrieve a table from a remote node
- `list_remote_datasets()`: List datasets available on a remote node
- `start_flight_server()`: Start a Flight server for accepting connections
- `stop_flight_server()`: Stop the Flight server

3. Streaming API
--------------
- `push_stream()`: Create a stream for pushing data in batches
- `pull_stream()`: Create a reader for consuming streaming data
- `write_batch()`: Write a batch of data to a stream
- `read_next_batch()`: Read the next batch from a stream

4. Notification API
-----------------
- `register_notification()`: Subscribe to data change events
- `unregister_notification()`: Unsubscribe from notifications

CROSS-LANGUAGE DATA FLOW
-----------------------
When data moves between languages, CrossLink employs a specific pathway:

1. Native formats (e.g., pandas DataFrame, R data.frame) are converted to language-specific Arrow tables
2. Language-specific Arrow tables are converted to C++ Arrow tables through the Arrow C Data Interface
3. C++ Arrow tables are stored and managed by the CrossLink core
4. When requested by another language, the C++ Arrow tables are converted back to language-specific Arrow tables
5. Language-specific Arrow tables are converted to native formats for the target language

In distributed mode using Flight:
1. Source node pushes data to its Flight server
2. Flight server sends record batches via gRPC streaming
3. Target node's Flight client receives the record batches
4. Target node reconstructs the table from the received batches

USE CASES AND APPLICATIONS
-------------------------
CrossLink addresses several common scenarios:

1. Multi-language Data Science Pipelines
---------------------------------------
Data scientists often need to combine the strengths of multiple languages:
- Python for machine learning and general-purpose programming
